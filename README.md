Module 11 Challenge – Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

Objective:
This challenge will apply the skills learned in Module 11 – Web Visualization Dashboard. This utilizes HTML and CSS to create a website by using visualizations that were created in Python-APIs challenge.

Project Details:
This project creates a website dashboard with individual pages for each plot and a way to navigate between them. The pages contain the visualizations and descriptions. The website contains a page to provide a comparison of all the plots, along with another page to present the data used to build them.

The website consists of seven pages, including:

1.    A [landing page](#landing-page) containing the following elements:
-    An explanation of the project.
-    Links to each visualizations page. 
-    A sidebar containing preview images of each plot. Clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

2.    Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages),  each with the following elements:
-    A descriptive title and heading tag.
-    The plot or visualization for the selected comparison (latitude vs: max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, or wind speed). 
-    A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
-    
3.    A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that does the following:
-    Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so they can easily be compared with each other.
-    Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

4.    A ["Data" page](#data-page) that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

At the top of every page, the website has a navigation menu with the following elements:
-    Name of the site on the left of the navigation bar, allowing users to return to the landing page from any page.
-    Dropdown menu on the right of the navigation bar, named "Plots," to provide links to each individual visualization page.
-    Links on the right: "Comparison," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
